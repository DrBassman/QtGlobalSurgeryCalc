# QtGlobalSurgeryCalc
Quick &amp; dirty script to assist in billing Medicare for global surgery procedures...

I wrote this application to assist my optometry practice when billing Medicare for global surgical care (i.e. cataract follow-up care).

I also wrote this software to learn PyQt5.

Nothing in this software shall be construed as council, advice or directions for billing Medicare (or any other 3rd party).

I developed this application using the following tools:
  * Windows 10 64-bit Pro Version 17.09
  * Python 3.6.3 (downloaded from python.org)
  * PyQt5 5.9.2 (installed using "pip install PyQt5")
  * Qt Designer 5.9.0.1.2 (installed using "pip install pyqt5-tools)

This application has been tested on the above system.  It should run on any system that has python, and PyQt5 (i.e. FreeBSD, MacOS, Linux, etc.).
